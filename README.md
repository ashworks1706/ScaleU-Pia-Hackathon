AI-powered collaborative Zoom sessions enhanced by real-time semantic search, Canvas resources, and multimodal agents.

### Pitch

- HiveMind uses Multimodal Agents to transform group study sessions into a real-time searchable knowledge hub and RAG Systems to instantly connect students.
- AI-Powered Professor (and Tutor) Agents that join your study session, to guide you towards the solution using Canvas resources reducing repetitive questions.
- We reimagine education as an inclusive, social, and evolving journey where every student can learn and connect at their own time ensuring equitable access

### Principled Innovation Framework

Moral - Recognize and address the ethical duty to avoid reinforcing systems that marginalize those who need additional support.
Civic - Consider how large, impersonal classroom settings fail to promote inclusive community engagement based on our experience.
Intellectual - Research practices to design social learning experiences while maintaining academic integrity.
Performance - Continuously evolve the AI-knowledge base to address educational needs and mitigate digital isolation.

Education is one of the most powerful tools for personal and professional growth, yet the way information is imparted had remained largely unchanged and inflexible. Traditional lectures are an one-size-fits-all approach to learning, which creates gaps in understanding and breeds isolation. Collaboration and peer-to-peer learning opportunities are limited. There is no structured way to connect those who eﬀortlessly grasp concepts with those who academically struggle alone. We built digital classrooms that adapt to every student’s needs, making learning more social, engaging, and inclusive.
